# OWOW Client Portal

A web-based dashboard platform designed to improve transparency and communication between **OWOW** and its clients.

Built with **Next.js (React)** as part of a 6-week collaborative project.

## 📌 Project Purpose

Currently, project updates between OWOW and clients rely heavily on manual communication (emails, meetings).  
This platform centralizes project information in one place and provides:

- Real-time project status overview
- Budget snapshot (spent vs remaining)
- Deliverables & file tracking
- Latest updates & milestones
- Team contact information

The goal is to improve communication efficiency and create a more transparent client experience.
